//Abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and is designed to be inherited by other classes. It serves as a blueprint for derived classes, providing a common interface and defining certain behaviors that must be implemented by the derived classes. In C++, an abstract class is created by declaring at least one pure virtual function, which is a virtual function that has no implementation in the base class and must be overridden in the derived class.

    public: 
    virtual void draw() = 0; // pure virtual function
